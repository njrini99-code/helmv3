# coachhelm ai test ledger

## 2026-09-04 — no new tests; the composer fixes ride the existing suite (PR #1828)

- `PromptComposer`'s Enter-by-pointer gate and `CoachHelmChat`'s per-conversation
  key are the same two fixes the team-message composer received, and are covered
  there by `MessageComposer.enterKey.test.tsx` and
  `FairwayMessages.composerScope.test.ts`. The CoachHelm siblings were changed
  identically and verified against the existing 299-test CoachHelm suite rather
  than duplicating those gates.
- Recorded deliberately: if the two composers ever diverge, this is the note
  that says the CoachHelm side has no gate of its own and should get one.
