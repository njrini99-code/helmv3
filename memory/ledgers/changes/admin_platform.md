# Admin Platform change ledger

## 2026-08-26 — Helm Bridge observability refit: capture, forensics, and organization

- SHA: recorded in the follow-up ledger commit on `feat/bridge-refit`.
- Audit: four-agent code audit of `src/app/admin`, `src/app/golf/admin`, the
  error pipeline, and the round-lifecycle migrations (2026-08-25).
- Change, in four parts:
  - **Resolution is one path.** `resolveErrorFingerprint` no longer performs a
    direct service-role `UPDATE`. It reads the open event ids for a fingerprint
    with the admin client, then resolves them through the same user-scoped
    `resolve_admin_event` RPC the triage queue uses, with the same
    `describeResolveFailure` translation and the same cache-tag bust. The
    fingerprint button gained the two-step confirm the bulk button already had.
    Before this, two privilege models wrote one `resolved` column and only one
    of them refreshed the nav badge.
  - **Detail that was captured is now shown.** The fingerprint page renders a
    forensics header over fields that were already being written to
    `admin_events.metadata` and never surfaced: Postgres error code and hint,
    request id, runtime, handled/unhandled, resolved source-file path, sport,
    feature, source, action, and — when present — a link to the round's flight
    trace. Each field copies individually. A 7-day occurrence strip and an
    elevated suspect-deploy line sit alongside it.
  - **Root cause moved into the product.** `analyzeErrorFingerprint` sends the
    incident report, stacks, classification, and deploy brackets to the model
    provider and stores a structured verdict as an `admin_events` row with
    `event_type='rca_analysis'`. Every incident query excludes that event type,
    so an analysis can never be counted as an occurrence of the thing it
    analyzes. Sentry-origin rows can now be resolved from inside the Bridge.
  - **The Overview answers "is anything on fire" first.** Status banner,
    briefing, a new severity-mix strip, and the triage queue sit above the
    fold; the KPI/posture boards moved into a remembered disclosure; the
    metric-truth panel dissolved into per-tile source notes so the provenance
    survived without a fourth full-width section. Feature health renders
    through one component in all three places that show it.
- Why: the Bridge captured far more than it displayed, resolved state through
  three code paths that could disagree, and buried the triage queue under
  three screens of posture. Operators could not see the detail needed to fix
  an error without leaving the tool.

## 2026-08-26 — client error context is redacted before it is stored

- SHA: recorded in the follow-up ledger commit on `feat/bridge-refit`.
- Change: `/api/log-error` now strips query strings and fragments from every
  URL-shaped value in the client-supplied context tree, and masks emails,
  before any write to `error_logs` / `admin_events`. `AdminErrorBoundary`
  reports through `logError` by default rather than only `console.error`.
- Why: the existing redaction ran on the Sentry path only. Browser diagnostics
  collect `location.href` and `referrer`, which can carry a magic-link token,
  OTP, or OAuth code — those were landing unredacted in tables any Bridge
  operator can read. Separately, an admin-surface crash caught by the boundary
  never reached the triage queue at all.
