## 2026-08-26 — Ask surface: no keyboard-on-open, honest empty pulse

- SHA: 596913022.
- Change: the Ask composer autofocus (CoachHelmChat `variant==='page' &&
  isEmpty`) now also requires a fine pointer; ProgramOpening renders a
  compact EmptyState (+ coverage line) instead of `return null` when the
  pulse has no items. Regression tests: ProgramOpening.empty.test.tsx;
  feature doc UI-contract updated same day.
- Why: owner TestFlight report — opening Ask on iPhone popped the keyboard
  over a page that was mostly blank cream, because an empty pulse left the
  flex-1 opening region stretching around nothing while the route skeleton
  had promised a findings list.
