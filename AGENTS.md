## Mobile UI rules

- Use the `mobile-app-consistency-system` skill for mobile web screens, responsive app UI, navigation, headers, cards, tabs, filters, buttons, chips, empty states, and layout refactors.
- All mobile screens must use the shared app shell with consistent safe-area handling, page padding, section spacing, and bottom-nav clearance.
- All mobile headers must use either a Standard header or an Action header pattern.
- Standard header: leading nav control, title, optional subtitle or meta, and at most one visible trailing action.
- Action header: leading nav control, title, and one primary CTA on the right.
- Do not stack multiple utility rows in the header unless there is no viable alternative.
- Bottom nav is reserved for primary everyday destinations only.
- Side drawer is reserved for secondary, team, admin, or account destinations.
- Avoid duplicating major destinations across bottom nav and drawer.
- Reuse shared button, chip, tab, card, metric, and empty-state components whenever possible.
- Do not introduce one-off spacing, radius, icon sizes, or control heights.
- Each screen should expose one clear primary action, a small number of secondary actions, and move lower-priority actions into overflow or a bottom sheet.
- Prefer calmer, denser, more scannable mobile layouts over decorative or oversized sections.
- Reduce top-of-screen chrome so users reach content earlier.
- Empty states should stay compact: icon, short title, one sentence, one CTA.
- Every changed mobile screen should feel visually and behaviorally consistent with the rest of the app.
