# CoachHelm Evidence Contract

Status: **ACTIVE** as of 2026-05-17.
Source: closes audit Findings 1, Q-NEW-1/2/3/5/12, A-NEW-3, S-HIGH-1 from
`.full-review-2026-05-17-golfhelm-audit/05-final-report.md`.

## Promise

Every insight emitted to `golf_coach_insights` carries an `evidence` JSON that
is internally consistent: when `comparison_source = X`, the `comparison_label`
and `comparison_value` originated from a single `BaselineRegistry` entry for X.
The three fields cannot disagree.

## Allowed `comparison_source` values

`InsightComparisonSource` is the discriminated union at
`src/lib/coachhelm/v2/insights/types.ts`. `peer_percentile` was removed in
2026-05-17.

| Source | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `your_baseline` | Player's own rolling history | last-N rounds putting make% |
| `team_avg` | Teammates' aggregated stats | team median scrambling rate |
| `d1_avg` / `d2_avg` / `d3_avg` / `naia_avg` / `juco_avg` | College-division benchmarks | D2 avg putting make% from 5ft |
| `pga_baseline` | PGA Tour reference | PGA avg fairway% |
| `absolute_target` | Fixed reference point | par, uniform-25% distribution |
| `estimated_target` | A derived coaching target, not a measured population average (women's-college anchors in `v3/counterfactual/cohort-baselines.ts`: LPGA/NCAA figures discounted to college). Rendered as "Estimated target". Labels built by `cohortAnchorLabel()` say `target (est.)`. | Women's college sand save target (est.) 38% |

A static test at `src/test/coachhelm/v2/insights/baseline-registry.test.ts`
fails CI if any miner emits a `comparison_source` outside this set.

## How a generator emits a comparison

Generators do **not** hard-code labels. They look up an entry by `BaselineKey`
(`${source}.${bucket}`) and spread the result:

```ts
import { baselineRegistry } from '@/lib/coachhelm/v2/insights/baseline-registry';
import type { BaselineKey } from '@/lib/coachhelm/v2/insights/types';

const baselineKey: BaselineKey = `d2_avg.putting_make_pct_${agg.label}`;
const baseline = baselineRegistry.get(baselineKey);  // { source, label, value }

const evidence: InsightEvidence = {
  // ...
  comparison_value: baseline.value,
  comparison_label: baseline.label,
  comparison_source: baseline.source,
  // ...
};
```

If a generator needs a comparison that doesn't yet have a registry entry, add
the entry to `baseline-registry.ts` and reference it. Adding a stand-alone
`comparison_label: '…'` string is forbidden.

## `sample_n` floor

- `MIN_SAMPLE_N = 5` is enforced at the typed `upsertInsight` entry point
  (`src/lib/coachhelm/v2/insights/upsert.ts`).
- The legacy `toInsightInput` adapter **returns `null`** when the inbound record
  lacks sufficient `sample_n` rather than clamping it up. Callers
  (`triggerPlayerInsightsAfterRound`, `generateInsightsForTeam`) filter `null`
  results and log skipped records via `logServerError`.
- A pattern with one real observation MUST NOT become an insight claiming
  `sample_n: 5`.

## Cross-coach dedup

`upsertInsight` dedups on `(signature, player_id, coach_id, team_id, created_at
>= cutoff)`. Two coaches at different organizations on the same transferred
athlete cannot silently overwrite each other's evidence — they each get a
distinct row.

The `triggerPlayerInsightsAfterRound` flow always passes an explicit `coach_id`
/ `team_id`. Bootstrap paths that don't know the coach yet (cron sweeps over
unowned rounds) fall through to `resolvePlayerOwnership` in `upsert.ts` — see
that function for ownership rules.

## Failure surface

- The orchestrator runs 9 tier-1 generators via `Promise.allSettled`. Every
  rejected result goes through `logServerError` with
  `action='analyzePlayer.tier1Generator'`, `featureArea='coachhelm'`,
  `playerId`, and `extra: { generator, reason }`.
- `analyzePlayer` returns `generatorSummary: { successes, failures }` on the
  `PlayerAnalysis` payload so callers can react to partial failure.
- `/api/coachhelm/analyze-player` currently returns 200 with `success: false` on
  engine-level failure. A follow-up will flip to 5xx when
  `generatorSummary.failures.length > 0` so platform-level observability sees
  real signal (audit Q-NEW-6, partially addressed).

## Claim honesty fields (2026-09-12, repair plan Package 2)

Three additive evidence fields let a row say what its numbers are without
renaming a metric id (a rename needs a compatibility map and signature migration
— deferred to addendum A2):

- `evidence.polarity` (`InsightEvidence`): Producer-declared direction of
  `your_value` (`higher_better` / `lower_better`). Set whenever `your_value` is
  not the registry quantity for `evidence.metric`. `tone-derivation.ts` resolves
  polarity as: `polarity` → registry direction (only when `evidence.unit` equals
  the registry unit) → name-pattern fallback on the metric **label** when the
  unit disagreed, else on the id. Rows written before the field existed resolve
  through the unit/label path.
- `DiagnosisDriver.label` (`evidence.diagnosis.drivers[]`): Human label for the
  driver's value; `DiagnosisPanel` prefers it over the registry display label.
  `buildDiagnosis` sets it from `evidence.metric_label`.
- `ComposedInsight.rankScore` (v2 round-review builders, `orchestrator.ts`):
  Diagnostic ranking magnitude for heuristic severities (severe rate × sample
  factor, leave gap / 10, …). Ordering reads `rankScore ?? strokeImpact`;
  nothing renders it as strokes. `strokeImpact` is reserved for stroke
  measurements.

Two generator-level flags on `BaseGenerator` keep a counterfactual or Tour
marker off a row whose player value is measured on a different basis than its
benchmark: `counterfactualComparable` (false → `counterfactual: null`) and
`standingTourComparable` (false → injected standing block carries `pga_omitted:
true`, the same render path the women's gender-anchor omission uses).
`ApproachMissGenerator` sets both false.

## Metric identity table (A0 deliverable — approach, scrambling, tee, course-hole)

| Measure | `evidence.metric` / key | Unit | Numerator | Denominator | Eligibility | Direction | Comparator | Producer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Green-hit rate per band | `approach_proximity_{50_125ft,125_175ft,175_plus_ft}` (registry id kept; `polarity: higher_better`, `unit: percent`, label "Greens hit from …") | percent | approaches from the band finishing on the green (`result` green/hole/gir) | approaches from the band in the 90-day window | ≥ 5 attempts in band; intent unknown (a par-5 lay-up logged as an approach counts — addendum A2 separates it) | higher_better | `greenHitAnchor(bucket, gender)`: men's approximate Tour band figure (`pga_baseline`), women's derived target (`estimated_target`) | `v3/generators/approach-miss.ts` |
| On-green proximity per band | same registry id; `standing.metric_id`, `agg.playerValue`, `evidence.detail.proximity_when_hit_feet` | feet | sum of finish distance for green-finding approaches | green-finding approaches (≥ 3) | as above, on-green finishes only | lower_better | team tick only (same basis). Tour marker omitted (`pga_omitted`) and no counterfactual: `pga_value` is all-shot proximity, misses included | approach-miss standing block; `standing/refresh.ts` |
| Short-approach on-green leave (composite) | `approach_proximity_50_125ft` on the `short_approach_proximity_gap` composite; `polarity: lower_better`, `unit: feet` | feet | `detail.proximity_when_hit_feet` of the source approach_miss row | green-finding approaches only | fires above `DIAL_IN_TARGET_FT` (22 ft) AND weak scrambling | lower_better | the rule's own threshold as `estimated_target` ("Dial-in target ~22 ft (est., on-green only)") — never a Tour all-shot proximity, same basis rule as the approach_miss row | `v3/composite/rules/short-approach-proximity-gap.ts` |
| GIR % | `gir_pct` | percent | holes with `golf_holes.gir = true` | holes played | per hole (regulation status as logged; addendum A1 re-derives it from total strokes incl. penalties) | higher_better | `cohortAnchor('gir_pct', gender)` / DB `pga_value` | stats cache; **a different id from green-hit rate by contract** |
| Miss-axis share | diagnosis driver `approach_miss_{short,long,left,right}_share` | percent | misses on the dominant pole of one axis | misses with a read on that axis (`n` in the observation) | ≥ 5 directional misses and share ≥ 0.55 (`dominantAxis`) | descriptive | none — an observation; the reading's `check` names what is not recorded (intent, club, wind, target) | `v3/engine/diagnosis.ts` `approachAxisReading` |
| Rough/sand recovery leave | `recovery_proximity_rough_sand` (composite; was `short_side_proximity`) | feet | sum of leave (yards ×3 normalised) | short-game shots from rough/sand (≥ 10) | shot record only — short-sidedness is **not** measured (needs pin position + miss side) | lower_better | Tour ~10 ft (approx), `strokes_impact_method: rough_estimate` | `composite/rules/short-side-scrambling-chain.ts` |
| Sand save % | `scrambling_pct_sand` | percent | up-and-downs from sand | sand attempts | 90-day shot window | higher_better | `cohortAnchor`; women's labelled `target (est.)` with `estimated_target` | `v3/generators/scrambling.ts` |
| Tee distance | `TeeStrategyShot.shot_distance` + `distance_method` | yards | — | — | `recorded` = logged travel; `derived_progress` = hole yardage − remaining (progress toward the hole, never carry) | — | driver vs non-driver averages; prose discloses the derived count when > 0 (0 of 7653 in production 2026-09-12) | `engine/shot-source.ts` → `generators/tee-strategy.ts` |
| Specific-hole scoring | `worst_holes[]` keyed by (`course_id`, `hole_number`) | strokes over par per play | sum of score − par | plays of that course-hole (≥ 3) | rounds with a `course_id`; rounds without one are excluded and the round count is stated in `worst_holes_excluded_rounds` (223 of 566 completed rounds on 2026-09-12 — a hole count would read as thousands). A course name is display metadata, never an identity | lower_better | none | `v3/generators/course-mgmt.ts` via `hole-diagnosis.ts` `DiagnosisHole.course_id` |
| Ordinal-hole scoring | `opening_hole_delta` | strokes | hole-1 score − par | rounds | grouped by hole **number** on purpose (an ordinal position, distinct signature and wording) | lower_better | DB `pga_value` | `v3/generators/warmup-hole.ts` |

## How to add a new comparison source

1. Append to `InsightComparisonSource` and `COMPARISON_SOURCES` in `types.ts`.
2. Add a registry entry at the right key in `baseline-registry.ts` — unless the
   source's values are owned elsewhere: `estimated_target` has no registry
   entries because its cohort anchors (`greenHitAnchor`, `cohortAnchor`,
   `DIAL_IN_TARGET_FT`) are derived per band/gender in
   `v3/counterfactual/cohort-baselines.ts` and the composite rules, and the
   label is built beside the value (`cohortAnchorLabel`) so the triple still
   cannot disagree.
3. Add a row to the `SOURCE_LABELS` map at
   `src/components/golf/coachhelm/insights/EvidencePanel.tsx` for user-facing
   rendering.
4. Update this doc.
