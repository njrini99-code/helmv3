# Tool contract notes

Changes to `tool.ts` against the contract in the rebuild brief, with the reason for each. ENGINE and TOOLS both write here.

## 2026-11-10 (ENGINE), first version

1. `run` returns `ToolResult`, not a bare `ToolEnvelope`. A `ToolEnvelope` is still a valid return. `ToolResult` adds three optional fields an envelope cannot express:
   - `parts`: UI parts beyond the evidence chip (a visual, an artifact, a brief, a handoff, a practice plan). The brief said "returns it in the envelope"; this is the field.
   - `evidence: false`: the result is not a read of team data (`show_visual`, `write_artifact`, a draft, a refusal), so it gets no evidence chip and no `evidence_ref`.
   - `end_turn: true`: the turn stops after this step (`ask_practice_brief` did this through `stopWhen`).
2. `ToolContext.reads`: the conversation's reads by `evidence_ref`. `show_visual` and `summarise_data` resolved refs through a map that `buildCoachTools` kept in a closure; the engine now owns the refs, so it hands the map in. Refs are `e1`, `e2`, … and are unique within a conversation for turns the new engine wrote.
3. `TaskTool.immediate`: skips the Undo window (`lock_lineup` did this with `immediate: true` on its flow).
4. `commit` receives the STORED proposal. `plan` is not run a second time on Confirm, so what the coach saw is what is written, and a card whose data moved underneath it is no longer silently dropped. `P` must be JSON-serialisable.
5. The engine rewrites `proposal.idempotency_key` before storing it: `<planner key, first 110 chars>:<hash of conversation id and the model's tool_use id>`. Each request by the model is one `tool_use` block, so a retried Confirm of one card is one key and an identical request made later is a new key (the audit's "legitimate repeats are swallowed"). `commit` must derive downstream request ids from the key it is given.
6. No `readBack` on the contract. `commit` reads back itself before returning a failed receipt; the engine records exactly the receipt it is given.
7. The engine, not the tool, calls `recordProposal`, `claimForExecution`, `holdForExecution`, `recordOutcome` and `recordDenial`, and checks their results. A proposal that cannot be recorded shows no Confirm card.
8. `toolsFor` is typed as `ToolsFor` here and implemented by TOOLS in `../registry.ts`. The order of the returned array is part of the cached prompt prefix: keep it stable for a surface.

## What the engine sends the model for each result

- read: `JSON.stringify({ ...envelope, evidence_ref })` without `parts`, `evidence`, `end_turn`.
- a read that threw, or an input that failed validation: an `is_error` result with one sentence.
- task proposed: nothing yet; the turn ends on the card. On the coach's decision the result is one of
  `Committed. <receipt summary>`, `Held until HH:MM:SS (the coach can still press Undo). <summary>`, `Declined by the coach. Nothing was written.`, `Failed: <reason>. Nothing was written.` (or what was), `The coach asked something else instead. Nothing was written.`

## 2026-11-10 (ENGINE), after TOOLS delivered the registry

9. `ScreenLoaders` is TOOLS's type (`../screen-loaders.ts`); `tool.ts` re-exports it, so there is one declaration. The route binds every loader that file lists, in `src/app/api/coachhelm/v3/chat/stream/route.ts` (only a route file may import a Clubhouse loader). A player's request binds only the player's own pages, with a teammate's id dropped before the loader is called.
10. The prompt comes from `instructionBlocks(surface, who, { today, notes })` as `{ policy, team }`; the engine sends them as two cached system blocks in that order.
11. The grounding check is TOOLS's `checkGrounding(text, reads)` (`../grounding.ts`), called after the turn with the conversation's reads. `engine/grounding.ts` is only the default when none is handed in.
12. Not on the contract yet: a detail line for a finished progress row ("38 rounds") and the practice picture. The old `progressEnd` added them from the envelope. If TOOLS wants them back, add `progress_detail?: string` to `ToolResult` and the engine will send it on `read_finished` (the event already has a `detail` field).

## 2026-11-10 (TOOLS)

1. `ScreenLoaders` is defined in `../screen-loaders.ts` (TOOLS) and re-exported by `tool.ts`. Its header lists the
   Clubhouse function the route binds to each field. Every field is optional; a tool whose loader is missing or
   returns null answers with an `unavailable` read.
2. Requested, not yet in `tool.ts` or `loop.ts`: `ToolResult.model_text?: string`. The screen readers set it: the read
   as labelled lines ("Scoring avg: 74.2 | team 75.1", places, gaps), about a seventh of the envelope's JSON. Wanted
   behaviour: when a result has `model_text`, the tool_result content is `[<evidence_ref>] <model_text>` and the
   envelope (with `model_text` kept on it) still goes to the evidence chip, the `reads` map and the grounding check.
   Until then `model_text` rides inside the JSON as one more field: correct, but each Stats read costs the model
   roughly 3,000 tokens where 400 would do.
3. Every `P` TOOLS returns is `ActionProposal & { tool: string; input: unknown; planned_at: string }`, JSON-safe.
   `commit` needs all three back unchanged: `input` is what is written, `planned_at` bounds the look for an earlier
   attempt's row, and `idempotency_key` (as rewritten by the engine) is the seed of every downstream request id.
4. `commit` never touches the ledger. It returns `completed`, or `failed` with a `summary` that says either
   "Nothing was saved." (it looked) or "I could not check whether anything was saved: look in <place> before trying
   again." (it could not look; `retryable` is false). The engine should pass that sentence to the model as it is.
5. `lock_lineup` refuses while the coach's own `set_lineup` for the same tournament is held or running. It finds it
   in the ledger under `proposed_input->proposal->input->>tournament_id` (and the old top-level shape).
6. Hold release, proposed (ENGINE owns `undo-hold.ts`): wait out the hold inside the Confirm request instead of in
   `after()`. The request is already open to stream the closing words: emit the held receipt, `await releaseHeld(...)`
   in the request, emit the final receipt, append the tool_result with what really happened (committed, undone,
   failed) and only then ask the model for its closing words. The write then never depends on `after()` surviving or
   on the coach's next request, and the stored sentence can no longer say "done" about something the coach undid.
   Keep `after()` only as the fallback for a browser that disconnects during the hold (do not abort the wait on the
   request signal), keep the card's GET and the sweep, and run the sweep on any signed-in coach page load, not only
   on a chat request. A cron cannot do these writes: each action reads the coach from the session.
